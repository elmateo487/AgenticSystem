{"id":"sv-946","title":"Consolidate SYSTEM V1.3 Documentation","description":"## Requirements\n\nConsolidate SYSTEM V1.3 documentation to eliminate redundancy, establish single sources of truth, and reduce token inefficiency.\n\n**Key Decisions from Human:**\n1. Skill files are Orchestrator-only - they contain spawn instructions, not agent content\n2. Each agent has ONE primary file (orientation file)\n3. BEADS_INTEGRATION.md remains as comprehensive reference\n4. Prefer clarity even if slightly verbose\n5. Scope includes: orientation/, skills/, agents/, templates/\n\n**Workflow Clarification:**\n- User invokes /engineer\n- Orchestrator reads skill file to learn how to spawn\n- Orchestrator spawns agent with prompt pointing to orientation file\n- Agent reads orientation file (NOT skill file)\n\n## Technical Context\n\n**Current State Analysis:**\n- Heavy redundancy: Core Principles repeated 5x, 3-Level Hierarchy repeated 2x, Beads Commands repeated 2-3x\n- Structural confusion: Skill files mix orchestrator instructions with agent-specific content\n- Token inefficiency: Historian orientation 336 lines, Engineer orientation 346 lines, Orchestrator orientation 310 lines\n- Skill file bloat: historian/SKILL.md 281 lines, orchestrator/SKILL.md 239 lines (should be ~60 lines like engineer/SKILL.md)\n\n**File Inventory:**\n- Skills: ~/.claude/skills/{engineer,historian,orchestrator}/SKILL.md\n- Orientations: orientation/{ENGINEER,HISTORIAN,ORCHESTRATOR}_ORIENTATION.md\n- Agents: agents/{ENGINEER,HISTORIAN,ORCHESTRATOR}_AGENT.md\n- Reference: docs/BEADS_INTEGRATION.md\n- Templates: templates/*.md\n\n## Design Rationale\n\n**Skill files should ONLY contain:**\n- Spawn protocol (Task tool parameters)\n- Prompt template pointing to orientation file\n- Output handling instructions for Orchestrator\n\n**Skill files should NOT contain:**\n- Agent role summary\n- Core Principles\n- 3-Level Hierarchy\n- Beads command examples\n- Agent-specific workflows\n\n**Rationale:** Agents never read their skill files. The Orchestrator reads skill files to spawn agents. Duplicating agent content in skill files wastes tokens and creates maintenance burden.\n\n**agents/ directory question:** May be redundant with orientation files.
