# SYSTEM V1.3 — Beads-Integrated Invocation-Only Agent Architecture

## Core Principles
- Nothing runs unless explicitly invoked by a human
- Tests define correctness
- Tests are sacrosanct
- Implementation quality is sacrosanct

## Template
Copy into a project and fill in. Do not edit templates in-place.

## Maintenance Protocol

Update this changelog when:
- New invariant or decision is added
- Existing item is modified significantly
- Item is removed or superseded
- Daily no-change entries are optional

Format:
- **Added**: New items that didn't exist before
- **Modified**: Changes to existing items (include what changed)
- **Removed**: Items that no longer apply
- **No changes**: Explicit note when reviewing but no changes made

Do NOT include:
- Typo fixes that don't change meaning
- Formatting-only changes
- Implementation status updates (those go in Beads epic comments)
