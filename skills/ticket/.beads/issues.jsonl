{"id":"ticket-bz0","title":"Cache curated frame phashes between pipeline stages to avoid redundant computation","description":"## Context\nCurrently, curated frame perceptual hashes (phashes) are computed twice during the pipeline: once in the CutVideoStage during boundary hardening (lines 209-211 in cut_video.py via BoundaryVerifier.compute_curated_hashes()) and again in the validation stage during final cleanliness verification. This redundant computation takes approximately 1 minute per pipeline run.\n\n## Requirements\n1. Cache the computed phashes in the artifact store after initial computation in CutVideoStage\n2. Reuse cached phashes in validation stage instead of recomputing\n3. Ensure cache is properly cleared when hits directory changes\n4. Maintain backward compatibility with existing code paths\n5. Add unit tests to verify caching behavior\n6. Document the caching strategy in code comments\n\n## Authority\nThis optimization is authorized under performance improvement guidelines. The boundary verification system is documented in cut_video.py lines 192-318 and BoundaryVerifier class in boundary/verifier.py lines 197-299.\n\n## Implementation Context\n- Current computation: BoundaryVerifier.compute_curated_hashes() in boundary/verifier.py (lines 250-299)\n- Usage location 1: CutVideoStage.execute() in cut_video.py (line 209)\n- Usage location 2: Validation framework in video_validator.py (needs investigation)\n- Artifact store available via context.artifacts for inter-stage data passing","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-11T19:51:06.761036-07:00","created_by":"minimatt","updated_at":"2026-01-11T19:51:06.761036-07:00","labels":["area:performance","type:ticket"]}
